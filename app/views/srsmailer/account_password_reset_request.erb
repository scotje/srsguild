Hello,

You (or possibly someone else) recently requested to reset your password
at srsguild.com. Your password has not yet been changed, in order to change
your password, please click on the link below and then follow the 
instructions.

	<%= url_for(:host => @host, :controller => 'accounts', :action => 'new_password', :reset_code => @account.password_reset_value) %>

(Note: This code is valid for 24 hours, you will need to request another one
if you are unable to complete this process in that time.)
	
If you did not request this password reset, you can safely ignore this email.
However, if this is happening repeatedly, please reply to this email and 
let us know. We will use the IP address shown below to try to block the person
responsible.


Thanks!
